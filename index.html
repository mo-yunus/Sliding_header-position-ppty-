            <h1 class="title">King Cobra</h1>
            <p>The king cobra was described and drawn by the Danish naturalist Theodore Edward Cantor in 1836, who gave
                it the scientific name Hamadryas hannah. Cantor had three specimens from the Sundarbans and one caught
                in the vicinity of kolkata. It was subordinated to the genus OphioPhagus by Albert Gunther in 1864.</p>
            <p>Ophiophagus hannah belongs to the monotypic genus Ophiophaus in the family Elapidae, while most other
                cobras are members of the genus Naja. They can be distinguished from other cobras by size and hood. King
                cobras are generally larger than other cobras, and the stripe on the neck is a chevron instead of a
                double or single eye shape that may be seen in most of the other Asian cobras. Moreover, the hood of the
                king cobra is narrower and longer. A key to identification, clearly visible on the head, is the presence
                of a pair of large scales known as occipitals, located at the back of the top of the head. These are
                behind the usual "nine-plate" arrangement of the colubrids and elapids, and are unique to the king
                cobra.</p>
            <p class="tallScreenText">The skin of king cobra is dark olive or brown with blak bands and white or yellow
                crossbands. The head is black with two crossbars near the snout and two behind eyes. Adult king cobras
                are 3.18 to 4m (10.4 to 13.1 ft) long. The longest known individual measured 5.85m (19.2 ft). Its belly
                is cream rows of smooth scales. Ventral scales are uniformly oval shaped. Dorsal scales are placed in an
                oblique arrangement. Males have 235 to 250 ventral scales, while females have 239 to 265. The subcaudal
                scales are single or paired in each row, numbering 83 to 96 in males and 77 to 98 in females.</p>
            <p class="tallScreenText">Juveniles are shiny black with narrow yelow bands (can be mistaken for a banded
                krait, but readily identified with its expandable hood). The head of a mature snake can be quite massive
                and bulky in appearance, though like all snakes, it can expand its jaws to swallow large prey items. It
                has proteroglyph dentition, meaning it has two short, fixed fangs in the front of the mouth, which
                channel venom into the prey like hypodermic needles. The average lifespan of a wild king cobra is about
                20years.</p>

            <h1 class="title">Swan</h1>
            <p>Swans are birds of the family Anatidae within the genus Cygnus. The swans close relatives include the
                geese and ducks. Swans are grouped with the closely related geese in the subfamily Anserinae where they
                form the tribe Cygnini. Sometimes, they are considered a distinct subfamily, Cygninae. There are six or
                seven living (and one extinct) species of swan in the genus Cygnus; in addition, there is another
                species known as the coscoroba swan, although this species is no longer considered one of the true swan.
                Swans usually mate for life, although "divorce" sometimes occurs, particularly following nesting
                failure, and if a mate dies, the remaining swan will take up with another. The number of eggs in each
                clutch ranges from three to eight.</p>
